http-fetch
==========

A simple module for get and post requests in Juice.

Usage is half-documented (hell, the thing is only half written) inline, but
here's an example:

    require( "http-fetch" ).getAsJSON( "http://foo/bar.json" );

To use it (for now) you'll need the combined xml_arabica and curl branches of
flusspferd. You can grab it at the xml_arabica branch on my fork.
